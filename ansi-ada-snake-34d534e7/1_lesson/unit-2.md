title: What are ANSI ESCAPE Codes

name: 2-snake
---

Let's discover ANSI escape codes! These special character sequences give us powerful control over the terminal.

1. **ANSI escape codes** are special sequences that **control the terminal** (not just print text)

2. **Think of them as a mini "protocol"** sent inside text:
   - Change colors
   - Move the cursor
   - Clear the screen
   - And much more!

3. **We'll explore this concept** of *text plus control information* throughout the tutorial

âœ… **Key insight:** ANSI codes let us create dynamic, interactive terminal applications.
