Let's meet Ada! This powerful programming language will be our tool for building the Snake game.

1. **Ada is a systems programming language** designed for **high-integrity engineering**:
   - Used in airplanes, rockets, and nuclear power plants
   - Built for mission-critical applications

2. **Ada is strongly typed** with one of the most advanced type systems among imperative languages:
   - Catches errors at compile time
   - Prevents many common programming mistakes

3. **Ada prioritizes reliability, safety, and maintainability** above all else:
   - Code that works correctly from the start
   - Easy to understand and modify later

âœ… **Key insight:** Ada's strict rules help us write better, more reliable code - perfect for learning good programming habits.
