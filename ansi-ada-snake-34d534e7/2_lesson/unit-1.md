title: Create a Game Engine Library in Ada

name: 1-snake
---

Let's create our first Ada library! We'll build a game engine called "noki" that will power our Snake game.

1. **Open a terminal** at the bottom of the IDE:
   - Drag up from the bottom edge
   - Or use the editor menu â†’ **Terminal â†’ New Terminal**

2. **Create the library** using Alire:
   ```bash
   alr -n init --lib noki
   ```

âœ… **Expected result:** Alire creates a new library project structure with all necessary files.

ðŸ¤¯ **Heads Up!** Always use `Ctrl+Shift+V` to paste in the terminal. This is different from regular copy-paste in the IDE.
