🚀 Beginning of Lesson 4 — Two Options

Each lesson starts with a new machine, you need to pull the latest code first, then either resume your own progress or start from the official snapshot.

🅰️ Option A — Resume from Your Fork (Recommended)

Clone your fork (replace <YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>):

```
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/snake-game-ada-course-code.git
cd snake-game-ada-course-code
```

Check out your saved progress to a branch:

```
git checkout -b lesson-04-work origin/lesson-03-work
```

✅ You're now ready to start Lesson 4 from your own progress.

🅱️ Option B — Start from Official Course Snapshot

Clone the official repository (read-only):

```
git clone https://github.com/GNAT-Academic-Program/snake-game-ada-course-code.git
cd snake-game-ada-course-code
```

Check out the starting point for Lesson 4:

```
git checkout -B lesson-04-work refs/tags/lesson-04-start
```

✅ You're now starting Lesson 4 from the clean official reference code.
